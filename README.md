# Rose City Resource Online

To start this application in development, clone the repository.

There are two `package.json` files for installing modules in the client and server.

cd ./rose-city-resource
npm install
```

For the client:

```
cd ./rose-city-resource/client
npm install

To run the stack in development after installs, change back to the root directory and run:

```
npm run dev
```
